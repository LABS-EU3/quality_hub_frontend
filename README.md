### redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

### redux-thunk

redux-thunk middleware, which allows simple asynchronous use of dispatch.

### redux-logger

A middleware which logs dispatched actions and the resulting new state.
An enhancer which logs the time taken for the reducers to process each action
